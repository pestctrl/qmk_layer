* Hey idiot
You forgot how to setup the dev environment for qmk? It's pretty
simple.

1. Install the qmk shell utility.
   - For windows, use msys.qmk.fm
   - For linux, either `pip install` or use package manager.
2. Clone qmk_firmware
   - ZSA's fork: https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware
   - Master: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware
3. Clone this repository into qmk_firmware/keyboards/moonlander/keymaps/$layout_name
4. Build with one of the following:
   - If you setup the qmk tool, `qmk compile -kb moonlander -km $layout_name`
   - If you were lazy, then `make moonlander:$layout_name`
